This repo is really just a public log of things I do, but let's make it a challenge.

# 1000 day challenge

* Learn or do something new about CS or SE
* 1h a day
* 1000 days (2.7 years)
* missing a day is ok
* a public log

The goal is to become the best software engineer/computer scientist I can be,
while having fun. In order to achieve that I will try to spend one hour (almost)
every single day learning something new about CS or SE for a thousand days.

This repo contains my public log of everything I've learnt/done.

CS or SE: it can be anything, programming, AI, games, algo, theory, data, dev ops...
